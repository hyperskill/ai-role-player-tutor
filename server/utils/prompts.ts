ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK:
Following evidence-based rubric development principles, conduct a holistic assessment that includes:

1. ANALYTICAL RUBRIC EVALUATION:
   - Assess each learning outcome/criteria systematically
   - Use descriptors ranging from exemplary (90-100%) to inadequate (0-20%)
   - Consider: understanding, application, analysis, synthesis, evaluation

2. COMPREHENSIVE FEEDBACK ANALYSIS:
   • BAD POINTS/AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT: Identify specific weaknesses, misconceptions, or missed opportunities
   • REACHED GOALS/STRENGTHS: Highlight demonstrated competencies and successful applications
   • GROWTH POINTS: Suggest specific areas for development and next steps
   • OVERALL PERFORMANCE: Holistic view of student's engagement and learning

3. EVIDENCE-BASED SCORING:
   - Analyze student responses against learning objectives
   - Consider depth of understanding, critical thinking, and practical application
   - Weight different aspects based on case complexity and learning goals

Provide your assessment in this EXACT JSON format:
{
  "assessment_percentage": <number between 0-100>,
  "detailed_feedback": {
    "strengths": ["<strength 1>", "<strength 2>", ...],
    "areas_for_improvement": ["<improvement 1>", "<improvement 2>", ...],
    "growth_points": ["<growth point 1>", "<growth point 2>", ...],
    "reached_goals": ["<goal 1>", "<goal 2>", ...],
    "overall_performance": "<comprehensive performance summary>"
  },
  "criteria_analysis": {
    "<criteria_name>": {
      "score_percentage": <0-100>,
      "feedback": "<specific feedback for this criteria>"
    }
  },
  "recommendations": ["<recommendation 1>", "<recommendation 2>", ...],
  "assessment_rationale": "<explanation of how the percentage was determined>"
}

Be thorough, fair, and constructive in your assessment. The percentage should reflect genuine learning achievement against the established criteria.`;
