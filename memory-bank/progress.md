# Progress: AI Role Player Tutor

## What Works
- **Core Learning Platform**: Complete case-based learning system with AI agent interactions
- **User Authentication**: Robust auth system with email/password and Google OAuth via Supabase
- **Real-time Chat Interface**: Smooth conversation experience with live message updates
- **AI Agent Responses**: Contextual, character-consistent responses using OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo
- **Progressive Case System**: Cases unlock based on prerequisite completion with dependency tracking
- **Subscription Management**: Full Stripe integration with webhook processing and access control
- **Responsive UI**: Modern, accessible interface using ShadCN Vue components and Tailwind CSS
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript implementation with auto-generated database types
- **Content Generation**: AI workflows for creating study cases and agents by domain

## What's Left to Build
- **Administrative Dashboard**: Interface for content managers to create, edit, and organize cases and agents
- **Learning Analytics**: Detailed user progress tracking, completion rates, and engagement metrics
- **Content Recommendation Engine**: AI-powered suggestions for next cases based on user performance
- **Advanced Chat Features**: File uploads, voice messages, conversation exports
- **Multi-domain Expansion**: More business domains beyond current case types
- **Assessment System**: Formal evaluation mechanisms for case completion and skill measurement
- **Instructor Portal**: Tools for educators to track student progress and assign specific cases
- **Mobile App**: Native mobile applications for iOS and Android platforms

## Known Issues and Limitations
- **AI Response Time**: Occasional delays in generating responses during peak usage
- **Content Scale**: Limited number of cases and agents, need systematic content expansion
- **Mobile UX**: Some chat interface elements could be optimized for mobile interactions
- **Error Handling**: Need more graceful fallbacks for AI generation failures
- **Performance Monitoring**: Limited visibility into system performance and user behavior
- **Content Quality**: Need systematic review process for AI-generated educational content
- **Internationalization**: Currently English-only, future multi-language support needed

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Original Architecture Decisions
- **Framework Choice**: Started with Nuxt 3 for full-stack TypeScript capabilities and Vue ecosystem
- **Database Selection**: Chose Supabase for real-time features and developer experience over traditional SQL setups
- **AI Integration**: Selected Vercel AI SDK for standardized AI provider integration and streaming support

### Iterative Improvements
- **Component Strategy**: Evolved from custom components to ShadCN Vue for consistency and accessibility
- **Authentication Flow**: Simplified from complex custom auth to Supabase Auth with OAuth providers
- **Type System**: Enhanced from basic types to comprehensive server/client type separation
- **AI Prompting**: Refined from generic responses to character-specific, context-aware agent behaviors

### Current Technical Debt
- **Database Migrations**: Need systematic approach to schema changes and version management
- **Testing Coverage**: Limited automated testing for AI interactions and real-time features
- **Documentation**: Code documentation could be more comprehensive for complex AI workflows
- **Configuration Management**: Environment variable handling could be more robust across deployment stages

### Future Considerations
- **Scaling Strategy**: Preparing for increased load with caching, CDN, and database optimization
- **AI Cost Management**: Implementing usage tracking and optimization for OpenAI API costs
- **Security Hardening**: Additional security measures for educational data and user privacy
- **Integration Capabilities**: APIs for third-party LMS and educational platform integration
