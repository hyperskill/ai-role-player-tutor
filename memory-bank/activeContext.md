# Active Context: AI Role Player Tutor

## Current Work Focus
**AI Content Generation Quality and Alignment**: Recent focus has been on improving the quality and consistency of AI-generated educational content. Key improvements have been made to ensure agent personas perfectly align with case stories, eliminating mismatches between case characters and chat agents.

**Key Active Areas:**
- **Content Management System**: Full CRUD operations for cases and agents with intuitive editing interfaces
- **Pro Subscription Features**: Advanced content creation and editing restricted to paid subscribers
- **AI-Powered Content Generation**: Streamlined workflows for generating educational content by domain
- **Administrative Dashboards**: Rich editing interfaces for customizing learning experiences
- **Enhanced Route Organization**: Better structured navigation and page organization
- **AI Content Quality Assurance**: Improved prompt engineering for consistent case-agent alignment

## Recent Changes
- **Prompt System Overhaul**: Fixed critical alignment issues between case generation and agent persona creation
  - Updated case generation prompt to require specific agent details (name, position, expertise) instead of placeholders
  - Enhanced agent generation prompt to extract exact agent information from case content
  - Added validation checkpoints to ensure agent personas match case stories precisely
- **Technical Response Fix**: Resolved JSON stringification issue causing escape characters and backslashes in agent responses
  - Fixed workflow to pass clean case content instead of stringified JSON objects
  - Eliminated display artifacts in chat interface
  - Improved user experience with properly formatted agent responses
- **Workflow Error Handling**: Enhanced content generation workflow with better error handling and validation
- **Content Management Suite**: Added comprehensive case creation (`pages/create-case.vue`) and editing (`pages/cases/[slug]/edit.vue`) interfaces
- **Pro Subscription Gating**: Implemented `requireProSubscription.ts` utility to restrict advanced features to paying users
- **Administrative API Endpoints**: Created full CRUD operations for cases (`[slug].delete.ts`, `[slug].patch.ts`) and agents (`agents/[id].patch.ts`)
- **Route Restructuring**: Migrated from single case page to organized directory structure with separate index and edit views
- **Database Schema Enhancements**: Added realtime capabilities, improved RLS policies, language support, and user permission controls
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Added comprehensive progress tracking, real-time updates, and polling fallbacks for content generation

## Next Steps
- **Content Quality Validation**: Implement systematic testing of case-agent alignment in generated content
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Implement detailed usage analytics for Pro subscribers and administrators
- **Content Quality Assurance**: Systematic review and improvement processes for AI-generated content
- **Bulk Operations**: Mass import/export capabilities for educational content
- **Template System**: Pre-built case templates for common business scenarios
- **User Management**: Enhanced admin controls for user roles and permissions
- **Performance Optimization**: Caching strategies for content-heavy operations

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **AI Content Consistency**: Ensuring perfect alignment between case stories and agent personas through improved prompt engineering
- **Content Generation Quality**: Maintaining high educational standards while optimizing generation speed
- **Subscription Strategy**: Balancing free educational access with premium content creation features
- **Content Ownership**: Clear boundaries between user-generated and system-provided educational content
- **AI Quality Control**: Ensuring generated content meets educational standards and learning objectives
- **Scalability Architecture**: Preparing for increased content volume and user activity
- **User Experience Flow**: Optimizing the journey from content creation to student engagement

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Case-Agent Alignment**: All generated content must have perfectly matched agent personas and case story characters
- **Clean Content Flow**: Case content passed as clean text, not JSON, to avoid formatting artifacts
- **Pro-Gated Features**: Advanced content management requires active Pro subscription for access control
- **Real-time Updates**: Live progress tracking during AI content generation with polling fallbacks
- **Ownership Verification**: Strict user ownership checks for all content editing and deletion operations
- **Educational Focus**: Every administrative feature designed to enhance learning outcomes and engagement
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Features work without JavaScript but provide richer experience with it enabled

## Learnings and Project Insights
- **Prompt Engineering Importance**: Small changes in AI prompts can dramatically affect content consistency and user experience
- **JSON vs Text Handling**: Passing clean text content to AI systems produces better results than stringified JSON objects
- **Content Generation UX**: Technical fixes like eliminating escape characters significantly improve perceived quality
- **Subscription Value Proposition**: Pro features create clear value distinction while maintaining educational accessibility
- **Content Generation UX**: Real-time progress tracking significantly improves user confidence during AI generation
- **Administrative Efficiency**: Rich editing interfaces reduce content creation time and improve quality
- **Route Organization**: Structured page hierarchy improves maintainability and user navigation
- **Permission Boundaries**: Clear ownership and subscription checks prevent unauthorized access while enabling collaboration
- **Educational Content Management**: Comprehensive editing tools enable educators to fine-tune learning experiences for maximum effectiveness
